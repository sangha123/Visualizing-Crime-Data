Visualizing-Crime-Data
======================

Using d3 I have made a dynamic plot that shows the evolution of crime over the period of one year. The y-axis shows the total crime, the x-axis gives the number of burglaries, the slider shows the month, the colors represent different neighborhoods. If you hover over each of the circles it will give you the neighborhood name. The data wrangling is done using ipython. Example notebooks are also included.
